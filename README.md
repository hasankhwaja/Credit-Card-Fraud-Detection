# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## Project Purpose 

The Credit Card Fraud Detection System aims to develop a solution to identify fradulent transactions using a dataset detailing the use of credit cards. The importance of this project is illustrated by the significant financial risk fradulent activities pose to credit card users, merchants as well as other financial institutions, making the need to detect and prevent fraud critical. 

This project uses a simulated dataset taken from Kaggle which was generated using the Python library Faker. This dataset reflects the real world, detailing its patterns and challenges, including features related to transactions, customers, and merchants. This collection of features allows for the creation and evaluation of a variety of machine learning models. 

## Goals

1.) Develop a scalable and real-time simulation 
* Create a real-time transaction processing system using Apache Kafka and Spark
* Use the simulated data to reflect real world scenarios

2.) Develop a Predictive Model 
* Build and train machine learning models in order to predict fraud
* Models may include, but are not limited to, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests

3.) Feature Importance Analysis
* Utilize XGBoost to evaluate and identify key identifiers of fraudulent behaviors
* Calculate feature importance metrics
